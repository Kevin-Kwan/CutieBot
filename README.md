# CutieBot v2

## About

A custom, multi-purpose Music, Economy, Moderation, and Fun Discord Bot using Discord JS. This bot has slash command support. Also has ChatGPT functionality allowing for models 3.5 and 4 to be used, so you can chat with the bot! This bot can also play music and has an economy system as well utilizing MongoDB, so it is easy to set up and use! Feel free to contribute.
More features to come! The currently hosted bot has ~1,100 users.

## WARNING

Music playing works perfectly fine if running locally.
Music on MY bot VPS deployment is not working due to "Error: Sign in to confirm youâ€™re not a bot" from YouTube." I guess AWS IP ranges are banned from YouTube.
Please keep this mind and have plans to fix this issue or utilize cookies/proxies when deploying your bot based on this repo. I may update this once I test alternative methods.
